# React Machine

This is a step-sequencer written using React.js, Tone.js, HTML, and CSS.  The Tone.js library is used to handle audio synchronization and triggering of samples. It features 16 steps and 8 different samples and you can create patterns by activating and deactivating cells within the matrix.  There is also an effects pad which applies effects when the user clicks and drags over the pad.  The output frequency/amplitude is analyzed and visualized.
